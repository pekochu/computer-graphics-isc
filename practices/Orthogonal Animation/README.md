# Practice: Perspective animation

Image rendered with the Bresenham algorithm. With the previously performed programs we implemented 3D model transformation operations for rotating, moving and scaling. At the end approximately 240 frames were rendered for the video. The model rotates at 1.5Â° per frame about the Y-axis. [See frames](frames)
