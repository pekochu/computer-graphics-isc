## Assignments
1. Implementation of the line drawing algorithms such as Naive, DDA and Bresenham. Make Bresenham algorithm version using threads.
2. Implementation of the Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm with some parallelism method, such as Threads, CUDA Cores or something like that.
3. Read an .obj file from Blender and drawing the model with the Line Drawing Algorithm.
4. Animate the Blender model with rotation and make a video with it.
