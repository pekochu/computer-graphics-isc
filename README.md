## Assignments
1. [Implementation of the line drawing algorithms such as Naive, DDA and Bresenham. Make Bresenham algorithm version using threads.](https://github.com/pekochu/computer-graphics-isc/tree/main/practices/Drawing%20Line)
2. [Read an .obj file from Blender and drawing the model with the Line Drawing Algorithm.](https://github.com/pekochu/computer-graphics-isc/tree/main/practices/Reading%20Blender%20Objects)
3. [Animate the Blender model with rotation and make a video with it.](https://github.com/pekochu/computer-graphics-isc/tree/main/practices/Orthogonal%20Projection)
4. [Read an .obj file from Blender and parse it to a .vlf file for further assignments.](https://github.com/pekochu/computer-graphics-isc/tree/main/practices/Orthogonal%20Animation)
5. [Z-Buffer and Scanline](https://github.com/pekochu/computer-graphics-isc/tree/main/practices/ZBuffer)

# Summary
If you dont want to visit each practice, here are a TL;DR.
## Drawing Line
This is a image rendered by the program generating 500 random lines with a random color, drawing it with Naive Algorithm.

## Read from Blender
Image rendered with the Bresenham algorithm. I've exported an .obj file from Blender and read it with this program.

## Perspective projection
Image rendered with the Bresenham algorithm. I've take advantage of my CPU 3 cores to render all the XY, XZ, YZ views.

### XY View

### XZ View

### ZY View

## Animation!
One of the more frustating practices I ever had, just because I was strugling with centering the model, but, after MOTHS I finally figured out. Just check it out.
