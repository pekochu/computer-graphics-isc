2. [Read an .obj file from Blender and drawing the model with the Line Drawing Algorithm.](/tree/main/practices/Orthogonal+Projection/)
3. [Animate the Blender model with rotation and make a video with it.](/tree/main/practices/Orthogonal+Animation/)
4. [Read an .obj file from Blender and parse it to a .vlf file for further assignments.](/tree/main/practices/VLF+Parser/)
5. [Z-Buffer and Scanline](/tree/main/practices/ZBuffer/)

# Summary

## Drawing Line
This is a image rendered by the program generating 500 random lines with a random color, drawing it with Naive Algorithm.

## Read from Blender
Image rendered with the Bresenham's Algorithm. I've exported an .obj file from Blender and read it with this program.

## Perspective projection
Image rendered with the Bresenham's Algorithm. I've take advantage of my CPU 3 cores for render all the XY, XZ, YZ views.

### XY View

### ZY View

## Animation!
One of the more frustating practices I ever had, just because I was strugling with centering the model, but, after MOTHS I finally figured out. Just check it out.
