2. [Implementation of the Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm with some parallelism method, such as Threads, CUDA Cores or something like that.](./practices/Parallel+Drawing/)
3. [Read an .obj file from Blender and drawing the model with the Line Drawing Algorithm.](./practices/Orthogonal+Projection/)
4. [Animate the Blender model with rotation and make a video with it.](./practices/Orthogonal+Animation/)
